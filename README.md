# EX.7-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-SYSTEM-CALLS-READ-WRITE-FORK-OPEN-CLOSE

## Aim:
C program using open, read, write, close , create , fork() system calls.

### Theory:
There are 5 basic system calls that Unix provides for file I/O.

### 1.Create:
Used to Create a new empty file

### Syntax:
int create(char *filename, mode_t mode)

### Filename:
Name of the file which you want to create

### Mode:
Indicates permissions of new file.

### 2.Open:
Used to Open the file for reading, writing or both.

### Syntax:
int open(char *path, int flags [ , int mode ] );

### Path:
Path to file which you want to use

### Flags:
How you like to use ?

O_RDONLY: read only, O_WRONLY: write only, O_RDWR: read and write, O_CREAT: create file if it doesn’t exist, O_EXCL: prevent creation if it already exists

### Close:
Tells the operating system you are done with a file descriptor and Close the file which pointed by fd.

### Syntax:
int close(int fd); fd :file descriptor

### 4.Read:
From the file indicated by the file descriptor fd, the read() function reads cnt bytes of input into the memory area indicated by buf. A successful read() updates the access time for the file.

### Syntax:
int read(int fd, char *buf, int size);

fd: file descripter buf: buffer to read data from cnt: length of buffer

### 5.Write:
Writes cnt bytes from buf to the file or socket associated with fd. cnt should not be greater than INT_MAX (defined in the limits.h header file). If cnt is zero, write() simply returns 0 without attempting any other action.

### Syntax:
int write(int fd, char *buf, int size);

fd: file descripter buf: buffer to write data to cnt: length of buffer

*File descriptor is integer that uniquely identifies an open file of the process.
## ALGORITHM:

1.Start the program.

2.Open a file for O_RDWR for R/W,O_CREATE for creating a file ,O_TRUNC for truncate a file.

3.Using getchar(), read the character and stored in the string[] array.

4.The string [] array is write into a file close it.

5.Then the first is opened for read only mode and read the characters and displayed it and close the file.

6.Use Fork().

7.Stop the program.

## PROGRAM:
```
#include<sys/stat.h> 
#include<stdio.h> 
#include<fcntl.h> 
#include<sys/types.h> 
int main() 
{ 
int n,i=0; 
int f1,f2; 
char c,strin[100]; 
f1=open("data",O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC); 
while((c=getchar())!='\n') 
{ 
strin[i++]=c; 
 
} 
strin[i]='\0'; 
write(f1,strin,i); 
close(f1); 
f2=open("data",O_RDONLY); 
read(f2,strin,0); 
printf("\n%s\n",strin); 
close(f2); 
fork(); 
return 0; 
 
}
```

## OUTPUT:
![Screenshot 2023-10-13 092005](https://github.com/Madhan213/EX.7-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-SYSTEM-CALLS-READ-WRITE-FORK-OPEN-CLOSE/assets/130206230/044ed9b8-13da-4b50-8613-d87868e9fcb5)


## RESULT:
Thus, open, read, write, close , create , fork() system calls implemented successfully using c program.
